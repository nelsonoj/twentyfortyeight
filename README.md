By Nelson Odins-Jones (also known as z5122504 or nelsonoj)
To compile, clone the repo to your directory of choice and run make
Then ./2048 will run the program.
If you find any bugs please message me on OpenLearning

TODO: Add detection for game over (at the moment it simply doesn't exist)
TODO: Add comments and stuff to make it more pretty
TODO: Add unit tests as there are currently none (it was all done kind of quickly)

Have fun!!
