To compile, clone the repo to your directory of choice and run make
Then ./2048 will run the program.
If you find any bugs please message me on OpenLearning.

+Added detection for game over
TODO: Add comments and stuff to make it more pretty
TODO: Fix the bug where you can generate new tiles even if you don't move
TODO: Add unit tests as there are currently none (it was all done kind of quickly)

Have fun!!
